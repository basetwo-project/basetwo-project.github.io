      The digital asset movement
    </h4>

    <p>Since the introduction of the first cryptocurrency in 2009 and the first Initial coin offering (ICO) in 2013, the world has witnessed an incredible growth in the digital asset class. In 2017 alone the total market capitalization of digital assets and cryptocurrencies started at 18b and peaked at almost 650b before the end of the year.</p>

    <p>Industry growth is expected to continue in 2018 as trading volumes and new users rise, more blockchain companies enter the market, and existing blockchains solve their own challenges of scalability, privacy, and security. In parallel, regulators are embracing the transformative power of this distributed ledger technology with major world governments creating laws and environments to support innovation of this kind. To name a few, some of the largest organizations in the world such as the United Nations and the European Union have started initiatives using blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, The Bank of International Settlements is endeavoring to discover a way to digitize central bank funds and Goldman Sachs is starting their own cryptocurrency trading desk.</p>
